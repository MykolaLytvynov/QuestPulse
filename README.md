# Quest Pulse üß©

A Telegram-based quest booking platform built with **Spring Boot**, **RabbitMQ**, **PostgreSQL**, and **AWS S3 (MinIO)**. Participants can browse quests, book time slots, and receive photos after completing quests ‚Äî all within Telegram.

## Tech Stack
- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Web (REST)**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **RabbitMQ**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Flyway** (Database Migrations)
- **AWS S3** (MinIO)
- **SLF4J & Logback** (Logging)
- **Telegram Bot API**
- **Docker & Docker Compose**


## Features

- Telegram bot interface:
  - Browse available quests
  - View free time slots for a specific quest
  - Book a quest for a selected time
  - Review all active bookings
  - Users receive a notification via the Telegram bot with their photo after completing the quest.
- After a participant completes a quest, their photo is uploaded via REST API to AWS S3 (MinIO)
- **View uploaded photos** via MinIO dashboard:  
  üîó [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001)


### üß† Booking Flow (How it works)

1. User interacts with Telegram bot (e.g., `/start`, `/book`, `/details`)
2. Bot sends request to `quest-service` via RabbitMQ
3. `quest-service` returns available quests and times
4. User selects quest, date, and time
5. Booking is stored in PostgreSQL
6. Admin uploads photo using `/api/uploads`
7. `photo-service` uploads photo to S3 and sends it via RabbitMQ
8. The Telegram bot receives the photo and sends it directly to the user, along with a thank-you message.
